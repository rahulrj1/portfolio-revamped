# Rahul Kumar - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. I built this project to showcase my experience as a Backend Software Engineer, my technical skills, and the projects I've worked on.

The site is designed to be minimalist, high-performance, and responsive, leveraging the latest web technologies to reflect my passion for building scalable systems.

## 🚀 Built With

I used a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, type safety, and performance:

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15+](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Containerization**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## 📂 Project Structure

I organized the codebase to follow production-grade standards, separating data, logic, and UI:

- `src/data/`: Centralized content management (Experience, Projects, Skills).
- `src/components/`: Reusable React components used across the site.
- `src/app/`: Next.js App Router pages, layouts, and global styles.
- `src/types/`: TypeScript definitions for type safety.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Locally
